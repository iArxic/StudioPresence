# Installation

• Download [Server Here](https://github.com/iArxic/StudioPresence/releases/tag/v3.0.1) and [Roblox Plugin Here](https://www.roblox.com/library/11213975679/StudioPresence)  
• Next, extract the already installed [Server](https://github.com/iArxic/StudioPresence/releases/tag/v3.0.1) to a new folder (Inside desktop recommended).  
• Run it! _(If you're using **MacOS**, you must run it through the terminal, move to the location of the binary and execute `./roblox-drpc.macos`)_

You might have an issue with the antivirus incorrectly flagging it as a virus, click "keep" and if needed exclude the file from your antivirus.

_Note: The cmd window needs to be open in order for the plugin to work!_
